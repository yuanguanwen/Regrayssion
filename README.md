# Welcome to Regrayssion!

This repository contains our developed pipeline for fitting Schwarzschild black hole graybody factors (GBFs) using Symbolic Regression (SR).

Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. In this project, we apply SR to the study of GBFsâ€”quantities that are essential for deriving Hawking radiation but notoriously challenging to compute. Our approach identifies simple, human-interpretable analytical forms for GBFs of the Schwarzschild black hole. As a practical application, we use our pipeline to study primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter candidates. By employing the SR-derived GBF expressions, we place constraints on the PBH abundance using observations of the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background.
